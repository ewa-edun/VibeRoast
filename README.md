Footer: Funny tagline: “Motivating you through pure disrespect.” All rights Reserved. VibeRoast.  

1. add more excuses
2.  add like youtube and music playlists for the workouts
3. improve the styling and animation
4. Random “Hype Mode” Activation 🔥Sometimes, instead of roasting, it overhypes the user.
"YOU GOT THIS! TIME TO DESTROY THAT WORKOUT LIKE IT OWES YOU MONEY."
5. Excuse Detector 🤡: If they pick the same excuse/mood multiple times, give them a personalized roast.
"Oh, ‘Tired’ again? It’s called ‘sleep,’ try it sometime." 
6.  Dynamic Roasts Based on User Behavior: If they click "Roast Me Again" too many times, give them a harsher roast.
"Oh, still looking for an easy way out? Try actually moving instead."
7. Social sharing

That random hype stuff, I can make it like a different personality so they'll click a button to either be roasted or be overhyped.
